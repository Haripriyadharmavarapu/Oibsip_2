            </p>Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828
        </p> (some sources say 1835)in the town of Varanasi into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family.
        </p> She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.
        </p> Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai).
        </p> Her parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra.
        </p> Her mother died when she was four years old. Her father was the Commander of the war of Kalyanpranth. 
        </p>Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district. The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "beautiful " and "lively and cheerful".
        </p> She was educated at home and was taught to read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age;
        </p> her studies included shooting, horsemanship, fencing and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tantia Tope.
        </p>[dubious â€“ discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at this time.
        </p> And she was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to fight against social norms even in front of the whole society.

           </p> Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the palace and the temple, although sometimes she was carried in a palanquin.
           </p> Her horses included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according to historians she rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858. 
           </p>Her palace, the Rani Mahal, has now been converted into a museum. It houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th centuries AD.
